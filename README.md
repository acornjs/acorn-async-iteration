# Async iteration support for Acorn

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/acorn-async-iteration.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/acorn-async-iteration)

Since async iteration part of ECMAScript 2018, acorn now supports it out of the box. Just make sure that you use acorn >= 5.4.1 and set `ecmaVersion` >= 9. This plugin is deprecated.
